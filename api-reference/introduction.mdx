## Welcome

Xignature Open API is a service that implements a remote sign system. In this service Xignature will not accept client's document to be signed. We will only receive the Hash value sent by the client and return it in the form of a digital signature that has been signed on behalf of the signer.
The figure below is an explanation of the system topology applied to Open API.
